#### features that are yet to be added:
- camera punch when taking fall damage
- weapons functionality (shoot bullets, grenade, do damage)
- entity animation (cyclers/cine monsters are present in this repository but do not have any animation code yet)
- monsters
- some func_ entities
- platform entities and trains (that includes mister john_train too)
- seamless level transition (only thing left to do is figure out how to pass spawnflags info to client and stuff)

to compile the code you'll need to use visual studio 2022, maybe i'll port it to visual c++ 4 in the future
