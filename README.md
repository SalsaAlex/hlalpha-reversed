#### features that are yet to be added:
- camera punch when taking fall damage
- mp5 grenade
- monster ai
- some func_ entities
- platform entities and trains (that includes mister john_train too)
- seamless level transition (only thing left to do is figure out how to pass spawnflags info to client and stuff)

to compile the code you'll need to use visual studio 2022, project file is located at "hlalpha-reversed/dlls/hl/hl.sln"
maybe i'll port it to visual c++ 4 in the future
